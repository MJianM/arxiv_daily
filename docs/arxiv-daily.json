        "title": "FAIL: Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning for Image Generation",
        "abstract": "Post-training of flow matching models-aligning the output distribution with a high-quality target-is mathematically equivalent to imitation learning. While Supervised Fine-Tuning mimics expert demonstrations effectively, it cannot correct policy drift in unseen states. Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. We propose Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. We derive two algorithms: FAIL-PD exploits differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings. Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks. Furthermore, the framework generalizes effectively to discrete image and video generation, and functions as a robust regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in reward-based optimization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/HansPolo113/FAIL.",

        "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models that directly predict multi-step action chunks from current observations face inherent limitations due to constrained scene understanding and weak future anticipation capabilities. In contrast, video world models pre-trained on web-scale video corpora exhibit robust spatiotemporal reasoning and accurate future prediction, making them a natural foundation for enhancing VLA learning. Therefore, we propose \\textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*}, a VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Built upon \\textit{GigaBrain-0.5}, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark. \\textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*} further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via \\textit{RAMP} (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation. Empirical results demonstrate that \\textit{RAMP} achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\\% on challenging tasks including \\texttt{Laundry Folding}, \\texttt{Box Packing}, and \\texttt{Espresso Preparation}.

        "abstract": "Training robotic policies directly in the real world is expensive and unscalable. Although generative simulation enables large-scale data synthesis, current approaches often fail to generate logically coherent long-horizon tasks and struggle with dynamic physical uncertainties due to open-loop execution. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning.",

The core of our system is a novel VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates robot embodiment priors, including multi-view camera parameters and kinematic descriptions (URDF), to enhance 3D spatial reasoning and support diverse embodiments. We validate this design through a scalable ``pre-train then post-train\" paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art results on simulation benchmarks such as RoboTwin 2.0, LIBERO, and GenieSim, as well as strong results on challenging long-horizon real-world manipulation tasks. Notably, our efficient 0.2B-parameter variant rivals significantly larger baselines, enabling low-latency on-device deployment. To further accelerate research and practical adoption, we fully open-source the entire HoloBrain ecosystem, which includes: (1) powerful pre-trained VLA foundations; (2) post-trained checkpoints for multiple simulation suites and real-world tasks; and (3) RoboOrchard, a full-stack VLA infrastructure for data curation, model training and deployment.

        "title": "When would Vision-Proprioception Policies Fail in Robotic Manipulation?",
        "abstract": "Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.",

        "abstract": "We hypothesize that a key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but a structural mismatch between current visual backbones and the physical requirements of closed-loop control. While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a \"blind spot\" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.",

        "abstract": "Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.",

        "abstract": "Reliable 3D instance segmentation is fundamental to language-grounded robotic manipulation. Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations.

This challenge is especially significant for low-cost robots designed for home use, as they must be both user-friendly and affordable. To address this, we propose the EasyMimic framework, a low-cost and replicable solution that enables robots to quickly learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations captured with standard RGB cameras. Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \\our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \\our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model.

Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.",

The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \\r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion.

        "abstract": "Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning.

        "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL), where the goal is to learn safe and reward-maximizing policies from demonstrations that do not have per-timestep safety cost or reward information. In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.",

Unlike prior methods operating in camera-centric coordinates, our model constructs occupancy representations in a global workspace frame, making it directly applicable to robotic manipulation. The model integrates flexible source views and generalizes to unseen object arrangements without scene-specific finetuning. We demonstrate the approach on a humanoid robot and evaluate predicted geometry against 3D sensor ground truth.

Existing methods are either supervised, relying on proxy tasks and explicit alignment, or unsupervised, aligning distributions without paired data, but often unstable. We introduce the Semi-Supervised CDIL (SS-CDIL) setting and propose the first algorithm for SS-CDIL with theoretical justification. Our method uses only offline data, including a small number of target expert demonstrations and some unlabeled imperfect trajectories. To handle domain discrepancy, we propose a novel cross-domain loss function for learning inter-domain state-action mappings and design an adaptive weight function to balance the source and target knowledge. Experiments on MuJoCo and Robosuite show consistent gains over the baselines, demonstrating that our approach achieves stable and data-efficient policy learning with minimal supervision.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide high-level guidance, they cannot explicitly forecast future states, and existing world models either predict only short horizons or produce spatially inconsistent frames. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for fast and predictive video-conditioned action. Our approach first selects and adapts a robust video generation model to ensure reliable future predictions, then applies adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, and finally trains an action model that leverages both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that directly support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines.

Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\\approx 0.05$).

While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\\%, 48\\%, and 23\\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively.

Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce TIME, a next-generation task-centric benchmark comprising 50 fresh datasets and 98 forecasting tasks, tailored for strict zero-shot TSFM evaluation free from data leakage. Integrating large language models and human expertise, we establish a rigorous human-in-the-loop benchmark construction pipeline to ensure high data integrity and redefine task formulation by aligning forecasting configurations with real-world operational requirements and variate predictability. Furthermore, we propose a novel pattern-level evaluation perspective that moves beyond traditional dataset-level evaluations based on static meta labels.

Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering.

We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%.

Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model.

Existing methods based on model level or representation level knowledge transfer either require expensive local training or incur high communication costs and introduce unavoidable privacy risks. We reformulate this problem as a reinforcement learning style evaluation process and propose FedGRPO, a privacy preserving framework comprising two modules. The first module performs competence-based expert selection by building a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify the most suitable clients for each question. The second module leverages the \"Group Relative\" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function. By exchanging reward values instead of data or model updates, FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices. Empirical results on diverse domain tasks demonstrate that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional FedFMs baselines.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.",

We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning.

Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.",

Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.",

However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the \"intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.",

Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning.

We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance. Across 15 models, we observe substantially higher robustness for the strongest proprietary models on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.",

However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.",

Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost.

However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used.

This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA).

However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

Quality is better understood as multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a capability the model must acquire. We introduce SkillRater, a framework that decomposes data filtering into specialized raters - one per capability, each trained via meta-learning on a disjoint validation objective - and composes their scores through a progressive selection rule: at each training stage, a sample is retained if any rater ranks it above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples late. We validate this approach on vision language models, decomposing quality into three capability dimensions: visual understanding, OCR, and STEM reasoning. At 2B parameters, SkillRater improves over unfiltered baselines by 5.63% on visual understanding, 2.00% on OCR, and 3.53% on STEM on held out benchmarks. The learned rater signals are near orthogonal, confirming that the decomposition captures genuinely independent quality dimensions and explaining why it outperforms both unfiltered training and monolithic learned filtering.",

Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.",

In image classification, these models typically recover human-interpretable concepts from an image and use them for classification. Sparse concept recovery methods leverage the latent space of vision-language models to represent image embeddings as a sparse combination of concept embeddings. However, because such methods ignore the hierarchical structure of concepts, they can produce correct predictions with explanations that are inconsistent with the hierarchy. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept Embedding \\& Pursuit (HCEP), a framework that induces a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover the concepts present in an image. Given a hierarchy of semantic concepts, we construct a corresponding hierarchy of concept embeddings and, assuming the correct concepts for an image form a rooted path in the hierarchy, derive desirable conditions for identifying them in the embedded space. We show that hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings, whereas vanilla sparse coding fails. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Moreover, when the number of samples is limited, HCEP achieves superior classification accuracy and concept recovery.

Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the \"intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments.

Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks.

        "abstract": "In this work, we introduce HoloBrain-0, a comprehensive Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that bridges the gap between foundation model research and reliable real-world robot deployment. The core of our system is a novel VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates robot embodiment priors, including multi-view camera parameters and kinematic descriptions (URDF), to enhance 3D spatial reasoning and support diverse embodiments. We validate this design through a scalable ``pre-train then post-train\" paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art results on simulation benchmarks such as RoboTwin 2.0, LIBERO, and GenieSim, as well as strong results on challenging long-horizon real-world manipulation tasks. Notably, our efficient 0.2B-parameter variant rivals significantly larger baselines, enabling low-latency on-device deployment. To further accelerate research and practical adoption, we fully open-source the entire HoloBrain ecosystem, which includes: (1) powerful pre-trained VLA foundations; (2) post-trained checkpoints for multiple simulation suites and real-world tasks; and (3) RoboOrchard, a full-stack VLA infrastructure for data curation, model training and deployment. Together with standardized data collection protocols, this release provides the community with a complete, reproducible path toward high-performance robotic manipulation.",

        "title": "When would Vision-Proprioception Policies Fail in Robotic Manipulation?",
        "abstract": "Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.",

        "abstract": "Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.",

To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \\our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \\our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

        "abstract": "World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.",

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.",

        "abstract": "VLA models have achieved remarkable progress in embodied intelligence; however, their evaluation remains largely confined to simulations or highly constrained real-world settings. This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models.",

        "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) driving augments end-to-end (E2E) planning with language-enabled backbones, yet it remains unclear what changes beyond the usual accuracy--cost trade-off. We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide high-level guidance, they cannot explicitly forecast future states, and existing world models either predict only short horizons or produce spatially inconsistent frames. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for fast and predictive video-conditioned action. Our approach first selects and adapts a robust video generation model to ensure reliable future predictions, then applies adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, and finally trains an action model that leverages both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that directly support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy.

In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.   Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines.

We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs.

To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS).

In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2.

We introduce ST4VLA, a dual-system Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages Spatial Guided Training to align action learning with spatial priors in VLMs. ST4VLA includes two stages: (i) spatial grounding pre-training, which equips the VLM with transferable priors via scalable point, box, and trajectory prediction from both web-scale and robot-specific data, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training, which encourages the model to produce richer spatial priors to guide action generation via spatial prompting. This design preserves spatial grounding during policy learning and promotes consistent optimization across spatial and action objectives. Empirically, ST4VLA achieves substantial improvements over vanilla VLA, with performance increasing from 66.1 -> 84.6 on Google Robot and from 54.7 -> 73.2 on WidowX Robot, establishing new state-of-the-art results on SimplerEnv. It also demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen objects and paraphrased instructions, as well as robustness to long-horizon perturbations in real-world settings.

A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\\%, particularly in unseen environments. Our analysis further reveals which behaviors transfer effectively and the potential for scaling human data.",

Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions.

Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.",

However, real world mining environments impose severe constraints, including poor illumination, GPS denied conditions, irregular underground topologies and intermittent connectivity. These factors degrade perception accuracy, disrupt situational awareness and weaken distributed learning systems. At the same time, emerging cyber physical threats such as backdoor triggers, sensor spoofing, label flipping attacks, and poisoned model updates further jeopardize operational safety as mines adopt autonomous vehicles, humanoid assistance, and federated learning for collaborative intelligence. Energy constrained sensors also experience uneven battery depletion, creating blind spots in safety coverage and disrupting hazard detection pipelines. This paper presents a vision for a Unified Smart Safety and Security Architecture that integrates multimodal perception, secure federated learning, reinforcement learning, DTN enabled communication, and energy aware sensing into a cohesive safety framework. We introduce five core modules: Miner Finder, Multimodal Situational Awareness, Backdoor Attack Monitor, TrustFed LFD, and IoT driven Equipment Health Monitoring. These modules collectively address miner localization, hazard understanding, federated robustness, and predictive maintenance. Together, they form an end to end framework capable of guiding miners through obstructed pathways, identifying compromised models or sensors, and ensuring mission critical equipment reliability.

However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.",

Yet platforms beyond leg length remain largely out of reach because current RL training paradigms often converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose APEX, a system for perceptive, climbing-based high-platform traversal that composes terrain-conditioned behaviors: climb-up and climb-down at vertical edges, walking or crawling on the platform, and stand-up and lie-down for posture reconfiguration. Central to our approach is a generalized ratchet progress reward for learning contact-rich, goal-reaching maneuvers. It tracks the best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps, providing dense yet velocity-free supervision that enables efficient exploration under strong safety regularization. Based on this formulation, we train LiDAR-based full-body maneuver policies and reduce the sim-to-real perception gap through a dual strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering and inpainting to elevation maps during deployment. Finally, we distill all six skills into a single policy that autonomously selects behaviors and transitions based on local geometry and commands. Experiments on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (approximately 114% of leg length), with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, as well as smooth and stable multi-skill transitions.",

Yet, as humanoid robots begin to share our workplaces, homes, and public spaces, the design challenge expands. We must now consider not only factors for humans but also factors for humanoids, since both will coexist and interact within the same environments. Unlike conventional machines, humanoids introduce expectations of human-like behavior, communication, and social presence, which reshape usability, trust, and safety considerations. In this article, we introduce the concept of humanoid factors as a framework structured around four pillars - physical, cognitive, social, and ethical - that shape the development of humanoids to help them effectively coexist and collaborate with humans. This framework characterizes the overlap and divergence between human capabilities and those of general-purpose humanoids powered by AI foundation models. To demonstrate our framework's practical utility, we then apply the framework to evaluate a real-world humanoid control algorithm, illustrating how conventional task completion metrics in robotics overlook key human cognitive and interaction principles. We thus position humanoid factors as a foundational framework for designing, evaluating, and governing sustained human-humanoid coexistence.",

However, developing a unified controller that robustly supports diverse human motions remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically distill multiple expert policies into a single general policy, which often inevitably leads to performance degradation, particularly on highly dynamic motions. This paper presents TeleGate, a unified whole-body teleoperation framework for humanoid robots that achieves high-precision tracking across various motions while avoiding the performance loss inherent in knowledge distillation. Our key idea is to preserve the full capability of domain-specific expert policies by training a lightweight gating network, which dynamically activates experts in real-time based on proprioceptive states and reference trajectories. Furthermore, to compensate for the absence of future reference trajectories in real-time teleoperation, we introduce a VAE-based motion prior module that extracts implicit future motion intent from historical observations, enabling anticipatory control for motions requiring prediction such as jumping and standing up. We conducted empirical evaluations in simulation and also deployed our technique on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Using only 2.5 hours of motion capture data for training, our TeleGate achieves high-precision real-time teleoperation across diverse dynamic motions (e.g., running, fall recovery, and jumping), significantly outperforming the baseline methods in both tracking accuracy and success rate.",

The framework also generalizes across varying object properties, such as mass, size, and geometry, using the same tracking objective. This ability to robustly retarget diverse demonstrations opens the door to generating large-scale synthetic datasets of humanoid loco-manipulation trajectories, addressing a major bottleneck in real-world data collection.",

        "abstract": "Achieving stable and energy-efficient locomotion is essential for humanoid robots to operate continuously in real-world applications. Existing MPC and RL approaches often rely on energy-related metrics embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework, which require extensive hyperparameter tuning and often result in suboptimal policies. To address these challenges, we propose ECO (Energy-Constrained Optimization), a constrained RL framework that separates energy-related metrics from rewards, reformulating them as explicit inequality constraints. This method provides a clear and interpretable physical representation of energy costs, enabling more efficient and intuitive hyperparameter tuning for improved energy efficiency. ECO introduces dedicated constraints for energy consumption and reference motion, enforced by the Lagrangian method, to achieve stable, symmetric, and energy-efficient walking for humanoid robots. We evaluated ECO against MPC, standard RL with reward shaping, and four state-of-the-art constrained RL methods. Experiments, including sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfers on the kid-sized humanoid robot BRUCE, demonstrate that ECO significantly reduces energy consumption compared to baselines while maintaining robust walking performance. These results highlight a substantial advancement in energy-efficient humanoid locomotion.

        "title": "Now You See That: Learning End-to-End Humanoid Locomotion from Raw Pixels",
        "abstract": "Achieving robust vision-based humanoid locomotion remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the sim-to-real gap introduces significant perception noise that degrades performance on fine-grained tasks, and training a unified policy across diverse terrains is hindered by conflicting learning objectives. To address these challenges, we present an end-to-end framework for vision-driven humanoid locomotion. For robust sim-to-real transfer, we develop a high-fidelity depth sensor simulation that captures stereo matching artifacts and calibration uncertainties inherent in real-world sensing. We further propose a vision-aware behavior distillation approach that combines latent space alignment with noise-invariant auxiliary tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer from privileged height maps to noisy depth observations. For versatile terrain adaptation, we introduce terrain-specific reward shaping integrated with multi-critic and multi-discriminator learning, where dedicated networks capture the distinct dynamics and motion priors of each terrain type. We validate our approach on two humanoid platforms equipped with different stereo depth cameras. The resulting policy demonstrates robust performance across diverse environments, seamlessly handling extreme challenges such as high platforms and wide gaps, as well as fine-grained tasks including bidirectional long-term staircase traversal.",
