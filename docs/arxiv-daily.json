        "title": "BPP: Long-Context Robot Imitation Learning by Focusing on Key History Frames",
        "abstract": "Many robot tasks require attending to the history of past observations. For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations.",

        "title": "PhyScensis: Physics-Augmented LLM Agents for Complex Physical Scene Arrangement",
        "abstract": "Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation.",

        "title": "Affordance Transfer Across Object Instances via Semantically Anchored Functional Map",
        "abstract": "Traditional learning from demonstration (LfD) generally demands a cumbersome collection of physical demonstrations, which can be time-consuming and challenging to scale. Recent advances show that robots can instead learn from human videos by extracting interaction cues without direct robot involvement. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to generalize demonstrated interactions across different object instances that share similar functionality but vary significantly in geometry. In this work, we propose \\emph{Semantic Anchored Functional Maps} (SemFM), a framework for transferring affordances across objects from a single visual demonstration. Starting from a coarse mesh reconstructed from an image, our method identifies semantically corresponding functional regions between objects, selects mutually exclusive semantic anchors, and propagates these constraints over the surface using a functional map to obtain a dense, semantically consistent correspondence. This enables demonstrated interaction regions to be transferred across geometrically diverse objects in a lightweight and interpretable manner. Experiments on synthetic object categories and real-world robotic manipulation tasks show that our approach enables accurate affordance transfer with modest computational cost, making it well-suited for practical robotic perception-to-action pipelines.",

        "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving increasingly adopt generative planners trained with imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning. Diffusion-based planners suffer from modality alignment difficulties, low training efficiency, and limited generalization. Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/MSunDYY/DriveFine.",

The goal is to integrate the strengths of LLMs and VLMs with computational tools to automatically analyze and solve problems related to robotic manipulators. Our developed framework accepts both textual and visual inputs and can automatically perform forward and inverse kinematics, compute velocities and accelerations of key points, generate 3D simulations of the robot, and ultimately execute motion control within the simulated environment, all according to the user's query. To evaluate the framework, three benchmark tests were designed, each consisting of ten questions. In the first benchmark test, the framework was evaluated while connected to GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3.2, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5, as well as their corresponding raw models. The objective was to extract the forward kinematics of robots directly from textual descriptions. The results showed that the framework integrated with GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 0.97 in computing the final solution, whereas the raw model alone attained an accuracy of only 0.30 for the same task. Similarly, for the other two models, the framework consistently outperformed the corresponding raw models in terms of accuracy. The second benchmark test was identical to the first, except that the input was provided in visual form. In this test, the GPT-4o LLM was used alongside the Gemini 2.5 Pro VLM. The results showed that the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.93 in obtaining the final answer, which is approximately 20% higher than that of the corresponding raw model. The third benchmark test encompassed a range of robotic tasks, including simulation, control, velocity and acceleration computation, as well as inverse kinematics and Jacobian calculation, for which the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.97.",

        "abstract": "Contact-rich manipulation tasks in unstructured environments pose significant robustness challenges for robot learning, where unexpected collisions can cause damage and hinder policy acquisition. Existing soft end-effectors face fundamental limitations: they either provide a limited deformation range, lack directional stiffness control, or require complex actuation systems that compromise practicality. This study introduces CLAW (Compliant Leaf-spring Anisotropic soft Wrist), a novel soft wrist mechanism that addresses these limitations through a simple yet effective design using two orthogonal leaf springs and rotary joints with a locking mechanism. CLAW provides large 6-degree-of-freedom deformation (40mm lateral, 20mm vertical), anisotropic stiffness that is tunable across three distinct modes, while maintaining lightweight construction (330g) at low cost ($550). Experimental evaluations using imitation learning demonstrate that CLAW achieves 76% success rate in benchmark peg-insertion tasks, outperforming both the Fin Ray gripper (43%) and rigid gripper alternatives (36%). CLAW successfully handles diverse contact-rich scenarios, including precision assembly with tight tolerances and delicate object manipulation, demonstrating its potential to enable robust robot learning in contact-rich domains.

Unlike prior imitation learning-based approaches that rely on human demonstrations and are often brittle to disturbances, AdaptManip aims to train a robust loco-manipulation policy via reinforcement learning without human demonstrations or teleoperation data. The proposed framework consists of three coupled components: (1) a recurrent object state estimator that tracks the manipulated object in real time under limited field-of-view and occlusions; (2) a whole-body base policy for robust locomotion with residual manipulation control for stable object lifting and delivery; and (3) a LiDAR-based robot global position estimator that provides drift-robust localization. All components are trained in simulation using reinforcement learning and deployed on real hardware in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results show that AdaptManip significantly outperforms baseline methods, including imitation learning-based approaches, in adaptability and overall success rate, while accurate object state estimation improves manipulation performance even under occlusion. We further demonstrate fully autonomous real-world navigation, object lifting, and delivery on a humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "Understanding an agent's goals from its behavior is fundamental to aligning AI systems with human intentions. Existing goal recognition methods typically rely on an optimal goal-oriented policy representation, which may differ from the actor's true behavior and hinder the accurate recognition of their goal. To address this gap, this paper introduces Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL), which leverages imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn one goal-directed policy for each candidate goal directly from (potentially suboptimal) demonstration trajectories. By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings.

        "abstract": "Articulated object manipulation is essential for various real-world robotic tasks, yet generalizing across diverse objects remains a major challenge. A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF), a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point features reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP), an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation tasks, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation.

        "abstract": "Enhancing the generalization capability of robotic learning to enable robots to operate effectively in diverse, unseen scenes is a fundamental and challenging problem. Existing approaches often depend on pretraining with large-scale data collection, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming, or on semantic data augmentation techniques that necessitate an impractical assumption of flawless upstream object detection in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboAug, a novel generative data augmentation framework that significantly minimizes the reliance on large-scale pretraining and the perfect visual recognition assumption by requiring only the bounding box annotation of a single image during training. Leveraging this minimal information, RoboAug employs pre-trained generative models for precise semantic data augmentation and integrates a plug-and-play region-contrastive loss to help models focus on task-relevant regions, thereby improving generalization and boosting task success rates. We conduct extensive real-world experiments on three robots, namely UR-5e, AgileX, and Tien Kung 2.0, spanning over 35k rollouts. Empirical results demonstrate that RoboAug significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation baselines. Specifically, when evaluating generalization capabilities in unseen scenes featuring diverse combinations of backgrounds, distractors, and lighting conditions, our method achieves substantial gains over the baseline without augmentation. The success rates increase from 0.09 to 0.47 on UR-5e, from 0.16 to 0.60 on AgileX, and from 0.19 to 0.67 on Tien Kung 2.0.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points).

        "abstract": "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) frameworks like Option-Critic (OC) and Multi-updates Option Critic (MOC) have introduced significant advancements in learning reusable options. However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER.

While flow-based policies have recently proven effective in modeling complex action distributions with a fast deterministic sampling process, they still face a trade-off between expressiveness and computational burden, which is typically controlled by the number of flow steps. In this work, we propose mean velocity policy (MVP), a new generative policy function that models the mean velocity field to achieve the fastest one-step action generation. To ensure its high expressiveness, an instantaneous velocity constraint (IVC) is introduced on the mean velocity field during training. We theoretically prove that this design explicitly serves as a crucial boundary condition, thereby improving learning accuracy and enhancing policy expressiveness. Empirically, our MVP achieves state-of-the-art success rates across several challenging robotic manipulation tasks from Robomimic and OGBench.

        "abstract": "Understanding dynamic scenes from casual videos is critical for scalable robot learning, yet four-dimensional (4D) reconstruction under strictly monocular settings remains highly ill-posed. To address this challenge, our key insight is that real-world dynamics exhibits a multi-scale regularity from object to particle level. To this end, we design the multi-scale dynamics mechanism that factorizes complex motion fields. Within this formulation, we propose Gaussian sequences with multi-scale dynamics, a novel representation for dynamic 3D Gaussians derived through compositions of multi-level motion. This layered structure substantially alleviates ambiguity of reconstruction and promotes physically plausible dynamics. We further incorporate multi-modal priors from vision foundation models to establish complementary supervision, constraining the solution space and improving the reconstruction fidelity. Our approach enables accurate and globally consistent 4D reconstruction from monocular casual videos. Experiments of dynamic novel-view synthesis (NVS) on benchmark and real-world manipulation datasets demonstrate considerable improvements over existing methods.",

Existing cross-embodiment policies typically rely on shared-private architectures, which suffer from limited capacity of private parameters and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments. Evaluations across both simulation and real-world environments validate the superiority of MOTIF, which significantly outperforms strong baselines in few-shot transfer scenarios by 6.5% in simulation and 43.7% in real-world settings.

        "abstract": "Existing robotic manipulation methods primarily rely on visual and proprioceptive observations, which may struggle to infer contact-related interaction states in partially observable real-world environments. Acoustic cues, by contrast, naturally encode rich interaction dynamics during contact, yet remain underexploited in current multimodal fusion literature. Most multimodal fusion approaches implicitly assume homogeneous roles across modalities, and thus design flat and symmetric fusion structures. However, this assumption is ill-suited for acoustic signals, which are inherently sparse and contact-driven. To achieve precise robotic manipulation through acoustic-informed perception, we propose a hierarchical representation fusion framework that progressively integrates audio, vision, and proprioception. Our approach first conditions visual and proprioceptive representations on acoustic cues, and then explicitly models higher-order cross-modal interactions to capture complementary dependencies among modalities. The fused representation is leveraged by a diffusion-based policy to directly generate continuous robot actions from multimodal observations. The combination of end-to-end learning and hierarchical fusion structure enables the policy to exploit task-relevant acoustic information while mitigating interference from less informative modalities. The proposed method has been evaluated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, including liquid pouring and cabinet opening. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks, particularly in scenarios where acoustic cues provide task-relevant information not readily available from visual observations alone. Furthermore, a mutual information analysis is conducted to interpret the effect of audio cues in robotic manipulation via multimodal fusion.",

Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities.

However, existing approaches falter in zero-shot generalization: end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often lack the precision required for long-horizon tasks, while traditional hierarchical planners suffer from semantic rigidity when facing open-world variations. To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively. Notably, the system enables direct zero-shot transfer from fixed-base setups to mobile manipulation without fine-tuning or reconfiguration.

Hence, we investigate the impact of feature sets for collective behaviours. We select swarm feature sets and similarity measures from prior swarm robotics works, which mainly considered a narrow behavioural context and assess their robustness. We demonstrate that the interplay of feature set and similarity measure makes some combinations more suitable to distinguish groups of similar behaviours.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel physics-constrained Real-to-Sim pipeline that reconstructs physically consistent 3D scenes from single-view RGB-D data. Central to our approach is a differentiable optimization pipeline that explicitly models spatial dependencies via a contact graph, jointly refining object poses and physical properties through differentiable rigid-body simulation. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our reconstructed scenes achieve high physical fidelity and faithfully replicate real-world contact dynamics, enabling stable and reliable contact-rich manipulation.",

        "abstract": "Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models can generate plausible end-effector motions, yet they often fail in long-horizon, contact-rich tasks because the underlying hand-object interaction (HOI) structure is not explicitly represented. An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.",

        "abstract": "Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.",

Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning.

While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a \"blind spot\" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.",

Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution.

Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot.

        "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising for generalist robot manipulation but remain brittle in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially with limited real-robot data. To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \\our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \\our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

        "abstract": "Reasoning about failures is crucial for building reliable and trustworthy robotic systems. Prior approaches either treat failure reasoning as a closed-set classification problem or assume access to ample human annotations. Failures in the real world are typically subtle, combinatorial, and difficult to enumerate, whereas rich reasoning labels are expensive to acquire. We address this problem by introducing ARMOR: Adaptive Round-based Multi-task mOdel for Robotic failure detection and reasoning. We formulate detection and reasoning as a multi-task self-refinement process, where the model iteratively predicts detection outcomes and natural language reasoning conditioned on past outputs. During training, ARMOR learns from heterogeneous supervision - large-scale sparse binary labels and small-scale rich reasoning annotations - optimized via a combination of offline and online imitation learning. At inference time, ARMOR generates multiple refinement trajectories and selects the most confident prediction via a self-certainty metric. Experiments across diverse environments show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving over the previous approaches by up to 30% on failure detection rate and up to 100% in reasoning measured through LLM fuzzy match score, demonstrating robustness to heterogeneous supervision and open-ended reasoning beyond predefined failure modes.

Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.",

We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies.

Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \\r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion.

        "abstract": "Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning.

        "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL), where the goal is to learn safe and reward-maximizing policies from demonstrations that do not have per-timestep safety cost or reward information. In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.",

We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration.",

        "abstract": "Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.",

        "abstract": "Estimating causal quantities traditionally relies on bespoke estimators tailored to specific assumptions. Recently proposed Causal Foundation Models (CFMs) promise a more unified approach by amortising causal discovery and inference in a single step. However, in their current state, they do not allow for the incorporation of any domain knowledge, which can lead to suboptimal predictions. We bridge this gap by introducing methods to condition CFMs on causal information, such as the causal graph or more readily available ancestral information. When access to complete causal graph information is too strict a requirement, our approach also effectively leverages partial causal information. We systematically evaluate conditioning strategies and find that injecting learnable biases into the attention mechanism is the most effective method to utilise full and partial causal information. Our experiments show that this conditioning allows a general-purpose CFM to match the performance of specialised models trained on specific causal structures. Overall, our approach addresses a central hurdle on the path towards all-in-one causal foundation models: the capability to answer causal queries in a data-driven manner while effectively leveraging any amount of domain expertise.",

However, to understand a tool's purpose and features, FMs rely on natural-language tool descriptions, making these descriptions a critical component in guiding FMs to select the optimal tool for a given (sub)task and to pass the right arguments to the tool. While defects or smells in these descriptions can misguide FM-based agents, their prevalence and consequences in the MCP ecosystem remain unclear.   To address this, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 856 tools spread across 103 MCP servers, assessing their description quality and their impact on agent performance. We identify six components of tool descriptions from the literature, develop a scoring rubric utilizing these components, then formalize tool description smells based on this rubric. By operationalizing this rubric through an FM-based scanner, we find that 97.1% of the analyzed tool descriptions contain at least one smell, with 56% failing to state their purpose clearly. While augmenting these descriptions for all components improves task success rates by a median of 5.85 percentage points and improves partial goal completion by 15.12%, it also increases the number of execution steps by 67.46% and regresses performance in 16.67% of cases. These findings highlight a trade-off between agent performance and cost, as well as the context sensitivity of the performance gain. Furthermore, component ablations show that compact variants of different component combinations often preserve behavioral reliability while reducing unnecessary token overhead, enabling more efficient use of the FM context window and lower execution costs.",

StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.",

We present SAILS -- Segment Anything with Incrementally Learned Semantics, a training-free framework for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) that sidesteps these challenges entirely. SAILS leverages foundational models to decouple CISS into two stages: Zero-shot region extraction using Segment Anything Model (SAM), followed by semantic association through prototypes in a fixed feature space. SAILS incorporates selective intra-class clustering, resulting in multiple prototypes per class to better model intra-class variability. Our results demonstrate that, despite requiring no incremental training, SAILS typically surpasses the performance of existing training-based approaches on standard CISS datasets, particularly in long and challenging task sequences where forgetting tends to be most severe.

Decision trees are standardized into an edge-list representation and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only the outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via a dedicated LLM call, and delegates response generation to a separate inference step.

        "abstract": "Contact-rich manipulation tasks in unstructured environments pose significant robustness challenges for robot learning, where unexpected collisions can cause damage and hinder policy acquisition. Existing soft end-effectors face fundamental limitations: they either provide a limited deformation range, lack directional stiffness control, or require complex actuation systems that compromise practicality. This study introduces CLAW (Compliant Leaf-spring Anisotropic soft Wrist), a novel soft wrist mechanism that addresses these limitations through a simple yet effective design using two orthogonal leaf springs and rotary joints with a locking mechanism. CLAW provides large 6-degree-of-freedom deformation (40mm lateral, 20mm vertical), anisotropic stiffness that is tunable across three distinct modes, while maintaining lightweight construction (330g) at low cost ($550). Experimental evaluations using imitation learning demonstrate that CLAW achieves 76% success rate in benchmark peg-insertion tasks, outperforming both the Fin Ray gripper (43%) and rigid gripper alternatives (36%). CLAW successfully handles diverse contact-rich scenarios, including precision assembly with tight tolerances and delicate object manipulation, demonstrating its potential to enable robust robot learning in contact-rich domains.

During training, WIMLE weights each synthetic transition by its predicted confidence, preserving useful model rollouts while attenuating bias from uncertain predictions and enabling stable learning. Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2).

        "abstract": "Tabular anomaly detection is often handled by single detectors or static ensembles, even though strong performance on tabular data typically comes from heterogeneous model families (e.g., tree ensembles, deep tabular networks, and tabular foundation models) that frequently disagree under distribution shift, missingness, and rare-anomaly regimes. We propose MAD, a Multi-Agent Debating framework that treats this disagreement as a first-class signal and resolves it through a mathematically grounded coordination layer. Each agent is a machine learning (ML)-based detector that produces a normalized anomaly score, confidence, and structured evidence, augmented by a large language model (LLM)-based critic. A coordinator converts these messages into bounded per-agent losses and updates agent influence via an exponentiated-gradient rule, yielding both a final debated anomaly score and an auditable debate trace. MAD is a unified agentic framework that can recover existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts gating and learning-with-expert-advice aggregation, by restricting the message space and synthesis operator. We establish regret guarantees for the synthesized losses and show how conformal calibration can wrap the debated score to control false positives under exchangeability. Experiments on diverse tabular anomaly benchmarks show improved robustness over baselines and clearer traces of model disagreement",

        "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides spatially resolved measurements of gene expression, enabling characterization of the molecular landscape of human tissue beyond histological assessment as well as localized readouts that can be aligned with morphology. Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks. Additionally, SEAL encoders exhibit robust domain generalization on out-of-distribution evaluations and enable new cross-modal capabilities such as gene-to-image retrieval. Our work proposes a general framework for ST-guided finetuning of pathology foundation models, showing that augmenting existing models with localized molecular supervision is an effective and practical step for improving visual representations and expanding their cross-modal utility.",

To bridge the gap between preoperative planning and intraoperative execution, we present ARport, an augmented reality (AR) system that automatically maps pre-planned trocar layouts onto the patient's body surface, providing intuitive spatial guidance during surgical preparation. Methods: ARport, implemented on an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD), operates without any external sensors or markers, simplifying setup and enhancing workflow integration. It reconstructs the operative scene from RGB, depth, and pose data captured by the OST-HMD, extracts the patient's body surface using a foundation model, and performs surface-based markerless registration to align preoperative anatomical models to the extracted patient's body surface, enabling in-situ visualization of planned trocar layouts. A demonstration video illustrating the overall workflow is available online. Results: In full-scale human-phantom experiments, ARport accurately overlaid pre-planned trocar sites onto the physical phantom, achieving consistent spatial correspondence between virtual plans and real anatomy. Conclusion: ARport provides a fully marker-free and hardware-minimal solution for visualizing preoperative trocar plans directly on the patient's body surface.

Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities. We show through real-world experiments that our framework can be used to learn precise manipulation skills efficiently without any robot data, resulting in significantly more robust performance than using a grasp generator naively.",

        "abstract": "Template-free retrosynthesis methods treat the task as black-box sequence generation, limiting learning efficiency, while semi-template approaches rely on rigid reaction libraries that constrain generalization. We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data. Ablation studies further reveal that structural priors outperform brute-force scaling: a 280K-parameter model with proper ordering matches a 65M-parameter model without it.",

        "abstract": "Driven by advancements in foundation models, semantic scene graphs have emerged as a prominent paradigm for high-level 3D environmental abstraction in robot navigation. However, existing approaches are fundamentally misaligned with the needs of embodied tasks. As they rely on either offline batch processing or implicit feature embeddings, the maps can hardly support interpretable human-intent reasoning in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present INHerit-SG. We redefine the map as a structured, RAG-ready knowledge base where natural-language descriptions are introduced as explicit semantic anchors to better align with human intent. An asynchronous dual-process architecture, together with a Floor-Room-Area-Object hierarchy, decouples geometric segmentation from time-consuming semantic reasoning. An event-triggered map update mechanism reorganizes the graph only when meaningful semantic events occur. This strategy enables our graph to maintain long-term consistency with relatively low computational overhead. For retrieval, we deploy multi-role Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose queries into atomic constraints and handle logical negations, and employ a hard-to-soft filtering strategy to ensure robust reasoning. This explicit interpretability improves the success rate and reliability of complex retrievals, enabling the system to adapt to a broader spectrum of human interaction tasks. We evaluate INHerit-SG on a newly constructed dataset, HM3DSem-SQR, and in real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex queries, and reveal its scalability for downstream navigation tasks.

        "abstract": "Despite rapid progress, autonomous driving algorithms remain notoriously fragile under Out-of-Distribution (OOD) conditions. We identify a critical decoupling failure in current research: the lack of distinction between appearance-based shifts, such as weather and lighting, and structural scene changes. This leaves a fundamental question unanswered: Is the planner failing because of complex road geometry, or simply because it is raining? To resolve this, we establish navdream, a high-fidelity robustness benchmark leveraging generative pixel-aligned style transfer. By creating a visual stress test with negligible geometric deviation, we isolate the impact of appearance on driving performance. Our evaluation reveals that existing planning algorithms often show significant degradation under OOD appearance conditions, even when the underlying scene structure remains consistent. To bridge this gap, we propose a universal perception interface leveraging a frozen visual foundation model (DINOv3). By extracting appearance-invariant features as a stable interface for the planner, we achieve exceptional zero-shot generalization across diverse planning paradigms, including regression-based, diffusion-based, and scoring-based models. Our plug-and-play solution maintains consistent performance across extreme appearance shifts without requiring further fine-tuning. The benchmark and code will be made available.",

To address this challenge, we present a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that unifies joint state-action representation learning with imaginative roll-outs. We design a world model trained with variational auto-encoders and augment the model using the state-action learned embedding (SALE). SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions.

        "abstract": "Determining whether neural models internalize physical laws as world models, rather than exploiting statistical shortcuts, remains challenging, especially under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts. Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\\approx 0.05$).

While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\\%, 48\\%, and 23\\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively.

Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models.

Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model.

The core of our system is a novel VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates robot embodiment priors, including multi-view camera parameters and kinematic descriptions (URDF), to enhance 3D spatial reasoning and support diverse embodiments. We validate this design through a scalable ``pre-train then post-train\" paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art results on simulation benchmarks such as RoboTwin 2.0, LIBERO, and GenieSim, as well as strong results on challenging long-horizon real-world manipulation tasks. Notably, our efficient 0.2B-parameter variant rivals significantly larger baselines, enabling low-latency on-device deployment. To further accelerate research and practical adoption, we fully open-source the entire HoloBrain ecosystem, which includes: (1) powerful pre-trained VLA foundations; (2) post-trained checkpoints for multiple simulation suites and real-world tasks; and (3) RoboOrchard, a full-stack VLA infrastructure for data curation, model training and deployment. Together with standardized data collection protocols, this release provides the community with a complete, reproducible path toward high-performance robotic manipulation.",

        "abstract": "One important direction of Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) is leveraging data from small client models to enhance the performance of a large server-side foundation model. Existing methods based on model level or representation level knowledge transfer either require expensive local training or incur high communication costs and introduce unavoidable privacy risks. We reformulate this problem as a reinforcement learning style evaluation process and propose FedGRPO, a privacy preserving framework comprising two modules. The first module performs competence-based expert selection by building a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify the most suitable clients for each question. The second module leverages the \"Group Relative\" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function. By exchanging reward values instead of data or model updates, FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices. Empirical results on diverse domain tasks demonstrate that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional FedFMs baselines.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency.

        "abstract": "Efficient spatial reasoning requires world models that remain reliable under tight precision budgets. We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning.

        "abstract": "Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.",

Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.",

However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs. Extensive experiments show that SAFT outperforms current methods, achieving substantial improvements in zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets.

Low-rank factorization offers a promising route to reduce training and inference costs, but the community lacks a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights while matching the performance of the dense model. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary \"full-rank\" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor. To address this, we introduce Spectron: Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization, which dynamically bounds the resultant weight updates based on the current spectral norms of the factors. Our method enables stable, end-to-end factorized training with negligible overhead. Finally, we establish compute-optimal scaling laws for natively low-rank transformers, demonstrating predictable power-law behavior and improved inference efficiency relative to dense models.",

        "abstract": "The opioid epidemic remains one of the most severe public health crises in the United States, yet evaluating policy interventions before implementation is difficult: multiple policies interact within a dynamic system where targeting one risk pathway may inadvertently amplify another. We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support.",

        "abstract": "Medical image foundation models (MIFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for a wide range of clinical tasks, yet their development is constrained by the scarcity, heterogeneity, and high cost of large-scale annotated datasets. Here, we propose RaSD (Randomized Synthesis and Disentanglement), a scalable framework for pre-training MIFMs entirely on synthetic data. By modeling anatomical structures and appearance variations with randomized Gaussian distributions, RaSD exposes models to sufficient multi-scale structural and appearance perturbations, forcing them to rely on invariant and task-relevant anatomical cues rather than dataset-specific textures, thereby enabling robust and transferable representation learning. We pre-trained RaSD on 1.2 million 3D volumes and 9.6 million 2D images, and extensively evaluated the resulting models across 6 imaging modalities, 48 datasets, and 56 downstream tasks. Across all evaluated downstream tasks, RaSD consistently outperforms training-from-scratch models, achieves the best performance on 17 tasks, and remains comparable to models pre-trained on large real datasets in most others. These results demonstrate that the capacity of synthetic data alone to drive robust representation learning. Our findings establish a paradigm shift in medical AI, demonstrating that synthetic data can serve as a \"free lunch\" for scalable, privacy-preserving, and clinically generalizable foundation models.",

        "abstract": "Many robot tasks require attending to the history of past observations. For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations.",

Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening.

We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning.

Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space.

        "abstract": "Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) plays an important role in assembly tasks by enabling robots to plan and adjust their motions based on interactive, real-time human instructions. However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility.",

Although transformer-based OCR systems and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong aggregate accuracy, metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) provide limited insight into their reliability for scholarly use. We compare a dedicated OCR transformer (TrOCR) and a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (Qwen) on line-level historical English texts using length-weighted accuracy metrics and hypothesis driven error analysis.   While Qwen achieves lower CER/WER and greater robustness to degraded input, it exhibits selective linguistic regularization and orthographic normalization that may silently alter historically meaningful forms. TrOCR preserves orthographic fidelity more consistently but is more prone to cascading error propagation. Our findings show that architectural inductive biases shape OCR error structure in systematic ways.

We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale (e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2). Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT.

Yet, most available grounding datasets provide sparse supervision, with insufficient and low-diversity labels that annotate only a small subset of task-relevant elements per screen, which limits both coverage and generalization; moreover, practical deployment requires efficiency to enable low-latency, on-device use. We introduce ScreenParse, a large-scale dataset for complete screen parsing, with dense annotations of all visible UI elements (boxes, 55-class types, and text) across 771K web screenshots (21M elements). ScreenParse is generated by Webshot, an automated, scalable pipeline that renders diverse urls, extracts annotations and applies VLM-based relabeling and quality filtering. Using ScreenParse, we train ScreenVLM, a compact, 316M-parameter vision language model (VLM) that decodes a compact ScreenTag markup representation with a structure-aware loss that upweights structure-critical tokens. ScreenVLM substantially outperforms much larger foundation VLMs on dense parsing (e.g., 0.592 vs. 0.294 PageIoU on ScreenParse) and shows strong transfer to public benchmarks. Moreover, finetuning foundation VLMs on ScreenParse consistently improves their grounding performance, suggesting that dense screen supervision provides transferable structural priors for UI understanding.

        "abstract": "Existing multimodal document question answering methods universally adopt a supply-side ingestion strategy: running a Vision-Language Model (VLM) on every page during indexing to generate comprehensive descriptions, then answering questions through text retrieval. However, this \"pre-ingestion\" approach is costly (a 113-page engineering drawing package requires approximately 80,000 VLM tokens), end-to-end unreliable (VLM outputs may fail to be correctly retrieved due to format mismatches in the retrieval infrastructure), and irrecoverable once it fails. This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is \"Index for locating, not understanding\"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression).

        "abstract": "Most vision-language models (VLMs) are trained on English-centric data, limiting their performance in other languages and cultural contexts. This restricts their usability for non-English-speaking users and hinders the development of multimodal systems that reflect diverse linguistic and cultural realities. In this work, we reproduce and adapt the LLaVA-Next methodology to create a set of Polish VLMs. We rely on a fully automated pipeline for translating and filtering existing multimodal datasets, and complement this with synthetic Polish data for OCR and culturally specific tasks. Despite relying almost entirely on automatic translation and minimal manual intervention to the training data, our approach yields strong results: we observe a +9.5% improvement over LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B on a Polish-adapted MMBench, along with higher-quality captions in generative evaluations, as measured by human annotators in terms of linguistic correctness. These findings highlight that large-scale automated translation, combined with lightweight filtering, can effectively bootstrap high-quality multimodal models for low-resource languages. Some challenges remain, particularly in cultural coverage and evaluation. To facilitate further research, we make our models and evaluation dataset publicly available.",

Existing methods mainly rely on cross-modal alignment or inference-time prompting with Vision--Language Models (VLMs). These approaches do not explicitly learn structured event representations and often produce weak argument grounding in multimodal settings. To address these limitations, we propose RMPL, a Relation-aware Multi-task Progressive Learning framework for MEE under low-resource conditions. RMPL incorporates heterogeneous supervision from unimodal event extraction and multimedia relation extraction with stage-wise training. The model is first trained with a unified schema to learn shared event-centric representations across modalities.

However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision.

        "abstract": "Visual attention boosting has emerged as a promising direction for mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where existing methods primarily focus on where to boost by applying a predefined scaling to the attention of method-specific visual tokens during autoregressive generation. In this paper, we identify a fundamental trade-off in these methods: a predefined scaling factor can be too weak at some generation steps, leaving hallucinations unresolved, yet too strong at others, leading to new hallucinations. Motivated by this finding, we propose AdaVBoost, a token-level visual attention boosting framework that adaptively determines how much attention to boost at each generation step. Specifically, we introduce Visual Grounding Entropy (VGE) to estimate hallucination risk, which leverages visual grounding as a complementary signal to capture evidence mismatches beyond entropy. Guided by VGE, AdaVBoost applies stronger visual attention boosting to high-risk tokens and weaker boosting to low-risk tokens, enabling token-level adaptive intervention at each generation step.

Conventional paradigms predominantly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) using static datasets. However, these methods suffer from severe distributional shifts, as offline trajectories fail to capture the stochastic state transitions and real-time feedback of unconstrained wide web environments. In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward. This system effectively mitigates the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon navigation. Notably, our RL-enhanced model achieves a 38.1\\% success rate (pass@5) on WebArena, outperforming all existing monolithic baselines. 3) Operator Agent: We introduce a modular agentic framework, namely \\textbf{OpAgent}, orchestrating a Planner, Grounder, Reflector, and Summarizer.

        "abstract": "Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) can make semantic and visual inferences across diverse settings, providing valuable common-sense priors for robotic control. However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning. Across extensive real-world manipulation experiments, these two novel methods outperform prior embodied reasoning VLAs and VLM-based hierarchical baselines, including on challenging generalization and long-horizon tasks.

This benchmark reframes food portion estimation as an implicit-scale 3D reconstruction problem under monocular observations.

Benefiting from strong semantic modeling and robust generalization, VLM-based end-to-end approaches have emerged as the mainstream paradigm in recent years. However, these models often suffer from substantial inference latency, as they must auto-regressively generate long token sequences when processing long-form documents. In this work, motivated by the extremely long outputs and complex layout structures commonly found in document parsing, we propose a training-free and highly efficient acceleration method. Inspired by speculative decoding, we employ a lightweight document parsing pipeline as a draft model to predict batches of future tokens, while the more accurate VLM verifies these draft predictions in parallel. Moreover, we further exploit the layout-structured nature of documents by partitioning each page into independent regions, enabling parallel decoding of each region using the same draft-verify strategy. The final predictions are then assembled according to the natural reading order. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: on the general-purpose OmniDocBench, our method provides a 2.42x lossless acceleration for the dots.ocr model, and achieves up to 4.89x acceleration on long-document parsing tasks.

HoRAMA generates RT-compatible 3D models from RGB video readily captured using a smartphone or low-cost portable camera, by integrating MASt3R-SLAM dense point cloud generation with vision language model-assisted material assignment. The HoRAMA 3D reconstruction method is verified by comparing NYURay RT predictions, using both manually created and HoRAMA-generated 3D models, against field measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz across 12 TX-RX locations in a 700 square meter factory. HoRAMA ray tracing predictions achieve a 2.28 dB RMSE for matched multipath component (MPC) power predictions, comparable to the manually created 3D model baseline (2.18 dB), while reducing 3D reconstruction time from two months to 16 hours. HoRAMA enables scalable wireless digital twin creation for RT network planning, infrastructure deployment, and beam management in 5G/6G systems, as well as eventual real-time implementation at the edge.",

        "abstract": "Radiological diagnosis is a perceptual process in which careful visual inspection and language reasoning are repeatedly interleaved. Most medical large vision language models (LVLMs) perform visual inspection only once and then rely on text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which operates purely in the linguistic space and is prone to hallucination. Recent methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing visually related coordinates, such as bounding boxes. However, these remain a pseudo-visual solution: coordinates are still text and fail to preserve rich visual details like texture and density. Motivated by the interleaved nature of radiological diagnosis, we introduce MMRad-IVL-22K, the first large-scale dataset designed for natively interleaved visual language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. MMRad-IVL-22K reflects a repeated cycle of reasoning and visual inspection workflow of radiologists, in which visual rationales complement textual descriptions and ground each step of the reasoning process. MMRad-IVL-22K comprises 21,994 diagnostic traces, enabling systematic scanning across 35 anatomical regions. Experimental results on advanced closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that report generation guided by multimodal CoT significantly outperforms that guided by text-only CoT in clinical accuracy and report quality (e.g., 6\\% increase in the RadGraph metric), confirming that high-fidelity interleaved vision language evidence is a non-substitutable component of reliable medical AI. Furthermore, benchmarking across seven state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs demonstrates that models fine-tuned on MMRad-IVL-22K achieve superior reasoning consistency and report quality compared with both general-purpose and medical-specific LVLMs. The project page is available at https://github.com/qiuzyc/thinking_like_a_radiologist.",

We introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems, that guides (X)AI researchers, developers and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation user interfaces (XUI) with system capabilities. X-SYS organizes around four quality attributes named STAR (scalability, traceability, responsiveness, and adaptability), and specifies a five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). It maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple user interface evolution from backend computation. We implement X-SYS through SemanticLens, a system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models. SemanticLens demonstrates how contract-based service boundaries enable independent evolution, offline/online separation ensures responsiveness, and persistent state management supports traceability.

This work studies how robots can similarly exploit signs for mapless navigation in the open world. A central challenge lies in interpreting signs: real-world signs are diverse and complex, and their abstract semantic contents need to be grounded in the local 3D scene. We formalize this as sign grounding, the problem of mapping semantic instructions on signs to corresponding scene elements and navigational actions. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the semantic common-sense and reasoning capabilities required for this task, but are sensitive to how spatial information is represented. We propose SignScene, a sign-centric spatial-semantic representation that captures navigation-relevant scene elements and sign information, and presents them to VLMs in a form conducive to effective reasoning. We evaluate our grounding approach on a dataset of 114 queries collected across nine diverse environment types, achieving 88% grounding accuracy and significantly outperforming baselines.

Using IndicFairFace, we quantify intra-national geographical bias in prominent CLIP-based VLMs and reduce it using post-hoc Iterative Nullspace Projection debiasing approach. We also show that the adopted debiasing approach does not adversely impact the existing embedding space as the average drop in retrieval accuracy on benchmark datasets is less than 1.5 percent.

The system consists of two components: (1) a social navigation framework implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 that integrates real-time RGB-D perception using an OAK-D Lite camera, YOLOv8-based object detection, COMPOSER-based collective activity recognition, D* Lite dynamic path planning, and haptic feedback via vibration motors for tasks such as locating a vacant seat; and (2) an agentic multimodal LLM-VLM interaction framework that integrates speech recognition, vision language models, large language models, and text-to-speech, with dynamic routing between voice-only and vision-only modes to enable natural voice-based communication, scene description, and object localization from visual input. The system is evaluated through a combination of simulation-based tests, real-world field experiments, and user-centered studies. Results from simulated and real indoor environments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and socially compliant navigation, achieving an overall system accuracy of approximately 80% under different social conditions. Group activity recognition further shows robust performance across diverse crowd scenarios. In addition, a preliminary exploratory user study with eight visually impaired and low-vision participants evaluates the agentic interaction framework through structured tasks and a UTAUT-based questionnaire reveals high acceptance and positive perceptions of usability, trust, and perceived sociability during our experiments.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning has become a key technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks, motivating its extension to vision language models (VLMs). While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning.",

Rather than applying uniform learning rates, NAST scales each layer's update according to its causal contribution to negation processing, transforming mechanistic interpretability signals into a principled optimization rule.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the \"intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments.

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON).

In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition.

To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning.",

Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results suggest that small (local) VLMs struggle with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA, the results reach F1 score at 0.91, surpassing the TimeSformer results of 0.70.",

However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.",

Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost.

However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used.

This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA).

Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation.

It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

Quality is better understood as multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a capability the model must acquire. We introduce SkillRater, a framework that decomposes data filtering into specialized raters - one per capability, each trained via meta-learning on a disjoint validation objective - and composes their scores through a progressive selection rule: at each training stage, a sample is retained if any rater ranks it above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples late. We validate this approach on vision language models, decomposing quality into three capability dimensions: visual understanding, OCR, and STEM reasoning. At 2B parameters, SkillRater improves over unfiltered baselines by 5.63% on visual understanding, 2.00% on OCR, and 3.53% on STEM on held out benchmarks.

Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors.

        "abstract": "Reasoning about failures is crucial for building reliable and trustworthy robotic systems. Prior approaches either treat failure reasoning as a closed-set classification problem or assume access to ample human annotations. Failures in the real world are typically subtle, combinatorial, and difficult to enumerate, whereas rich reasoning labels are expensive to acquire. We address this problem by introducing ARMOR: Adaptive Round-based Multi-task mOdel for Robotic failure detection and reasoning. We formulate detection and reasoning as a multi-task self-refinement process, where the model iteratively predicts detection outcomes and natural language reasoning conditioned on past outputs. During training, ARMOR learns from heterogeneous supervision - large-scale sparse binary labels and small-scale rich reasoning annotations - optimized via a combination of offline and online imitation learning. At inference time, ARMOR generates multiple refinement trajectories and selects the most confident prediction via a self-certainty metric. Experiments across diverse environments show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving over the previous approaches by up to 30% on failure detection rate and up to 100% in reasoning measured through LLM fuzzy match score, demonstrating robustness to heterogeneous supervision and open-ended reasoning beyond predefined failure modes.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has become a standard post-training stage for boosting visual reasoning in vision-language models, yet it remains unclear what capabilities RL actually improves compared with supervised fine-tuning as cold-start initialization (IN). End-to-end benchmark gains conflate multiple factors, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific skills. To bridge the gap, we propose a Frankenstein-style analysis framework including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains. Overall, our results suggest that RL's reliable contribution in visual reasoning is not a uniform enhancement of visual perception, but a systematic refinement of mid-to-late transformer computation that improves vision-to-reasoning alignment and reasoning performance, highlighting the limitations of benchmark-only evaluation for understanding multimodal reasoning improvements.",

Synthetic image detection (SID) has thus become an important area of research. Prior work has highlighted how synthetic images differ from real photographs--unfortunately, SID methods often struggle to generalize to novel generative models and often perform poorly in practical settings. CLIP, a foundational vision-language model which yields semantically rich image-text embeddings, shows strong accuracy and generalization for SID. Yet, the underlying relevant cues embedded in CLIP-features remain unknown. It is unclear, whether CLIP-based detectors simply detect strong visual artifacts or exploit subtle semantic biases, both of which would render them useless in practical settings or on generative models of high quality. We introduce SynthCLIC, a paired dataset of real photographs and high-quality synthetic counterparts from recent diffusion models, designed to reduce semantic bias in SID. Using an interpretable linear head with de-correlated activations and a text-grounded concept-model, we analyze what CLIP-based detectors learn. CLIP-based linear detectors reach 0.96 mAP on a GAN-based benchmark but only 0.92 on our high-quality diffusion dataset SynthCLIC, and generalization across generator families drops to as low as 0.37 mAP. We find that the detectors primarily rely on high-level photographic attributes (e.g., minimalist style, lens flare, or depth layering), rather than overt generator-specific artifacts. CLIP-based detectors perform well overall but generalize unevenly across diverse generative architectures. This highlights the need for continual model updates and broader training exposure, while reinforcing CLIP-based approaches as a strong foundation for more universal, robust SID.",

Instead of distilling high-dimensional Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings using model-specific decoders, LatentAM proposes an online dictionary learning approach that is both model-agnostic and pretraining-free, enabling plug-and-play integration with different VLMs at test time. Specifically, our approach associates each Gaussian primitive with a compact query vector that can be converted into approximate VLM embeddings using an attention mechanism with a learnable dictionary. The dictionary is initialized efficiently from streaming observations and optimized online to adapt to evolving scene semantics under trust-region regularization. To scale to long trajectories and large environments, we further propose an efficient map management strategy based on voxel hashing, where optimization is restricted to an active local map on the GPU, while the global map is stored and indexed on the CPU to maintain bounded GPU memory usage.

        "abstract": "Interpretable-by-design models are gaining traction in computer vision because they provide faithful explanations for their predictions. In image classification, these models typically recover human-interpretable concepts from an image and use them for classification. Sparse concept recovery methods leverage the latent space of vision-language models to represent image embeddings as a sparse combination of concept embeddings. However, because such methods ignore the hierarchical structure of concepts, they can produce correct predictions with explanations that are inconsistent with the hierarchy. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept Embedding \\& Pursuit (HCEP), a framework that induces a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover the concepts present in an image. Given a hierarchy of semantic concepts, we construct a corresponding hierarchy of concept embeddings and, assuming the correct concepts for an image form a rooted path in the hierarchy, derive desirable conditions for identifying them in the embedded space. We show that hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings, whereas vanilla sparse coding fails. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Moreover, when the number of samples is limited, HCEP achieves superior classification accuracy and concept recovery. These results show that incorporating hierarchical structures into sparse coding yields more reliable and interpretable image classification models.",

In this paper, we propose DiNa-LRM, a diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states. Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. DiNa-LRM leverages a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling, providing a diffusion-native mechanism for test-time scaling and robust rewarding. Across image alignment benchmarks, DiNa-LRM substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of the computational cost.

To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory.

        "abstract": "Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) plays an important role in assembly tasks by enabling robots to plan and adjust their motions based on interactive, real-time human instructions. However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility.",

We introduce TikArt (Thinking Aperture), an aperture-guided agent that casts multi-step vision-language reasoning as a decision process over regions of interest. TikArt follows a Think-Aperture-Observe loop, alternating between language generation and two aperture actions: Zoom extracts rectangular crops, while Segment invokes SAM2 to obtain mask-based crops for irregular targets. After every action, the model must produce an explicit observation, turning local visual cues into persistent linguistic memory. Built on Qwen3-VL-8B, TikArt optimizes its reasoning policy with AGRPO, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning algorithm with a two-stage curriculum: it warms up segmentation actions and then jointly optimizes visual math, fine-grained VQA, and segmentation, using rewards that couple task success with purposeful aperture use.

A primary challenge w.r.t AU detection is the effective learning of discriminative and generalizable AU representations under conditions of limited annotated data. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Vision-language Interaction for AU Understanding (HiVA) method, which leverages textual AU descriptions as semantic priors to guide and enhance AU detection. Specifically, HiVA employs a large language model to generate diverse and contextually rich AU descriptions to strengthen language-based representation learning. To capture both fine-grained and holistic vision-language associations, HiVA introduces an AU-aware dynamic graph module that facilitates the learning of AU-specific visual representations. These features are further integrated within a hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture comprising two complementary mechanisms: Disentangled Dual Cross-Attention (DDCA), which establishes fine-grained, AU-specific interactions between visual and textual features, and Contextual Dual Cross-Attention (CDCA), which models global inter-AU dependencies. This collaborative, cross-modal learning paradigm enables HiVA to leverage multi-grained vision-based AU features in conjunction with refined language-based AU details, culminating in robust and semantically enriched AU detection capabilities. Extensive experiments show that HiVA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, qualitative analyses reveal that HiVA produces semantically meaningful activation patterns, highlighting its efficacy in learning robust and interpretable cross-modal correspondences for comprehensive facial behavior analysis.",

Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points).

Modern generalist robot policies, such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, often lack the high-fidelity physical grounding required for contact-rich tool manipulation. Conversely, existing contact-aware policies that leverage tactile or haptic sensing are typically instance-specific and fail to generalize across diverse tool geometries. Bridging this gap requires learning unified contact representations from diverse data, yet a fundamental barrier remains: diverse real-world tactile data are prohibitive at scale, while direct zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to the complex dynamics of nonlinear deformation of soft sensors.   To address this, we propose Semantic-Contact Fields (SCFields), a unified 3D representation fusing visual semantics with dense contact estimates. We enable this via a two-stage Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline: first, we pre-train on a large simulation data set to learn general contact physics; second, we fine-tune on a small set of real data, pseudo-labeled via geometric heuristics and force optimization, to align sensor characteristics. This allows physical generalization to unseen tools. We leverage SCFields as the dense observation input for a diffusion policy to enable robust execution of contact-rich tool manipulation tasks.

Existing cross-embodiment policies typically rely on shared-private architectures, which suffer from limited capacity of private parameters and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments. Evaluations across both simulation and real-world environments validate the superiority of MOTIF, which significantly outperforms strong baselines in few-shot transfer scenarios by 6.5% in simulation and 43.7% in real-world settings.

While reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization can greatly improve efficiency, existing methods fail to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, causing quantization errors to accumulate under long-horizon closed-loop execution and severely degrade actions. To fill this gap, we propose HBVLA, a VLA-tailored binarization framework. First, we use a policy-aware enhanced Hessian to identify weights that are truly critical for action generation. Then, we employ a sparse orthogonal transform for non-salient weights to induce a low-entropy intermediate state. Finally, we quantize both salient and non-salient weights in the Harr domain with group-wise 1-bit quantization. We have evaluated our approach on different VLAs: on LIBERO, quantized OpenVLA-OFT retains 92.2% of full-precision performance; on SimplerEnv, quantized CogAct retains 93.6%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art binarization methods. We further validate our method on real-world evaluation suite and the results show that HBVLA incurs only marginal success-rate degradation compared to the full-precision model, demonstrating robust deployability under tight hardware constraints.

However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge.

The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning.

To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively.

We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies.

Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time.

Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training.

        "abstract": "Navigational signs enable humans to navigate unfamiliar environments without maps. This work studies how robots can similarly exploit signs for mapless navigation in the open world. A central challenge lies in interpreting signs: real-world signs are diverse and complex, and their abstract semantic contents need to be grounded in the local 3D scene. We formalize this as sign grounding, the problem of mapping semantic instructions on signs to corresponding scene elements and navigational actions. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the semantic common-sense and reasoning capabilities required for this task, but are sensitive to how spatial information is represented. We propose SignScene, a sign-centric spatial-semantic representation that captures navigation-relevant scene elements and sign information, and presents them to VLMs in a form conducive to effective reasoning. We evaluate our grounding approach on a dataset of 114 queries collected across nine diverse environment types, achieving 88% grounding accuracy and significantly outperforming baselines. Finally, we demonstrate that it enables real-world mapless navigation on a Spot robot using only signs.",

Xiaomi-Robotics-0 is first pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment robot trajectories and vision-language data, endowing it with broad and generalizable action-generation capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the visual-semantic knowledge of the underlying pre-trained VLM. During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks.

A fundamental challenge arises from the imbalance between high-entropy vision and language inputs and low-entropy but critical force signals, which often leads to over-reliance on perception and unstable control. To address this, we introduce CRAFT, a force-aware curriculum fine-tuning framework that integrates a variational information bottleneck module to regulate vision and language embeddings during early training. This curriculum strategy encourages the model to prioritize force signals initially, before progressively restoring access to the full multimodal information. To enable force-aware learning, we further design a homologous leader-follower teleoperation system that collects synchronized vision, language, and force data across diverse contact-rich tasks. Real-world experiments demonstrate that CRAFT consistently improves task success, generalizes to unseen objects and novel task variations, and adapts effectively across diverse VLA architectures, enabling robust and generalizable contact-rich manipulation.",

To bridge the domain gap between these asynchronous streams, we introduce an end-to-end finetuning protocol and a trajectory re-weighting strategy that prioritizes dynamic interactions. We evaluate our approach on real-world vision-based navigation tasks with communication delays up to 6 seconds.

An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\\times$ inference speedup.

        "abstract": "The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the \"intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.",

Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model.

        "abstract": "Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.",

However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.",

        "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising for generalist robot manipulation but remain brittle in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially with limited real-robot data. To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \\our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \\our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

We present Visual Foresight Planning (ForeAct), a general and efficient planner that guides a VLA step-by-step using imagined future observations and subtask descriptions. With an imagined future observation, the VLA can focus on visuo-motor inference rather than high-level semantic reasoning, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Our planner comprises a highly efficient foresight image generation module that predicts a high-quality 640$\\times$480 future observation from the current visual input and language instruction within only 0.33s on an H100 GPU, together with a vision-language model that reasons over the task and produces subtask descriptions for both the generator and the VLA. Importantly, state-of-the-art VLAs can integrate our planner seamlessly by simply augmenting their visual inputs, without any architectural modification. The foresight generator is pretrained on over 1 million multi-task, cross-embodiment episodes, enabling it to learn robust embodied dynamics.

        "abstract": "World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations.

        "abstract": "VLA models have achieved remarkable progress in embodied intelligence; however, their evaluation remains largely confined to simulations or highly constrained real-world settings. This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models.",

We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy.

To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning.

In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge, this is the first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment.

        "abstract": "Large vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but fall short when extended to embodied tasks, where instructions must be transformed into low-level motor actions. We introduce ST4VLA, a dual-system Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages Spatial Guided Training to align action learning with spatial priors in VLMs. ST4VLA includes two stages: (i) spatial grounding pre-training, which equips the VLM with transferable priors via scalable point, box, and trajectory prediction from both web-scale and robot-specific data, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training, which encourages the model to produce richer spatial priors to guide action generation via spatial prompting. This design preserves spatial grounding during policy learning and promotes consistent optimization across spatial and action objectives. Empirically, ST4VLA achieves substantial improvements over vanilla VLA, with performance increasing from 66.1 -> 84.6 on Google Robot and from 54.7 -> 73.2 on WidowX Robot, establishing new state-of-the-art results on SimplerEnv. It also demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen objects and paraphrased instructions, as well as robustness to long-horizon perturbations in real-world settings. These results highlight scalable spatially guided training as a promising direction for robust, generalizable robot learning.

While this paradigm has advanced robot-arm manipulation, its potential for the more challenging, data-hungry problem of humanoid loco-manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present EgoHumanoid, the first framework to co-train a vision-language-action policy using abundant egocentric human demonstrations together with a limited amount of robot data, enabling humanoids to perform loco-manipulation across diverse real-world environments. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, including discrepancies in physical morphology and viewpoint, we introduce a systematic alignment pipeline spanning from hardware design to data processing. A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\\%, particularly in unseen environments. Our analysis further reveals which behaviors transfer effectively and the potential for scaling human data.",

        "abstract": "Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) plays an important role in assembly tasks by enabling robots to plan and adjust their motions based on interactive, real-time human instructions. However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility.",

The proposed framework consists of three coupled components: (1) a recurrent object state estimator that tracks the manipulated object in real time under limited field-of-view and occlusions; (2) a whole-body base policy for robust locomotion with residual manipulation control for stable object lifting and delivery; and (3) a LiDAR-based robot global position estimator that provides drift-robust localization. All components are trained in simulation using reinforcement learning and deployed on real hardware in a zero-shot manner.

We present \\emph{ProAct}, a dual-system framework that reconciles this time-scale conflict by decoupling a low-latency \\emph{Behavioral System} for streaming multimodal interaction from a slower \\emph{Cognitive System} which performs long-horizon social reasoning and produces high-level proactive intentions. To translate deliberative intentions into continuous non-verbal behaviors without disrupting fluency, we introduce a streaming flow-matching model conditioned on intentions via ControlNet. This mechanism supports asynchronous intention injection, enabling seamless transitions between reactive and proactive gestures within a single motion stream. We deploy ProAct on a physical humanoid robot and evaluate both motion quality and interactive effectiveness. In real-world interaction user studies, participants and observers consistently prefer ProAct over reactive variants in perceived proactivity, social presence, and overall engagement, demonstrating the benefits of dual-system proactive control for embodied social interaction.",

We find that naively reusing the same pretrained WBC can reduce robustness over long horizons, as new skills and their compositions induce shifted state and command distributions. We address this with a simple data aggregation procedure that augments shared-WBC training with rollouts from closed-loop skill execution under domain randomization. To evaluate the approach, we introduce \\emph{Humanoid Hanoi}, a long-horizon Tower-of-Hanoi box rearrangement benchmark, and report results in simulation and on the Digit V3 humanoid robot, demonstrating fully autonomous rearrangement over extended horizons and quantifying the benefits of the shared-WBC approach over non-shared baselines.",

A rigid impact model is used as the basis for a configuration-dependent metric that quantifies the variation between pre- and post-impact velocities. By finding configurations (postures) that minimize the aforementioned metric, spikes in the robot's state and input commands can be significantly reduced during impacts, improving safety and robustness. The problem of identifying impact-robust postures is posed as a min-max optimization of the aforementioned metric. To overcome the real-time intractability of the problem, we reformulate it as a gradient-based motion task that iteratively guides the robot towards configurations that minimize the proposed metric. This task is embedded within a task-space inverse dynamics (TSID) whole-body controller, enabling seamless integration with other control objectives. The method is applied to a kinematically redundant aerial manipulator performing repeated point contact tasks. We test our method inside a realistic physics simulator and compare it with the nominal TSID. Our method leads to a reduction (up to 51% w.r.t. standard TSID) of post-impact spikes in the robot's configuration and successfully avoids actuator saturation. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of kinematic redundancy for impact robustness using additional numerical simulations on a quadruped and a humanoid robot, resulting in up to 45% reduction of post-impact spikes in the robot's state w.r.t. nominal TSID.",

Martial arts represent an extreme case of highly dynamic human motion, characterized by rapid center-of-mass shifts, complex coordination, and abrupt posture transitions. However, datasets tailored to such high-intensity scenarios remain scarce. To address this gap, we construct KungFuAthlete, a high-dynamic martial arts motion dataset derived from professional athletes' daily training videos. The dataset includes ground and jump subsets covering representative complex motion patterns. The jump subset exhibits substantially higher joint, linear, and angular velocities compared to commonly used datasets such as LAFAN1, PHUMA, and AMASS, indicating significantly increased motion intensity and complexity. Importantly, even professional athletes may fail during highly dynamic movements. Similarly, humanoid robots are prone to instability and falls under external disturbances or execution errors. Most prior work assumes motion execution remains within safe states and lacks a unified strategy for modeling unsafe states and enabling reliable autonomous recovery. We propose a novel training paradigm that enables a single policy to jointly learn high-dynamic motion tracking and fall recovery, unifying agile execution and stabilization within one framework. This framework expands robotic capability from pure motion tracking to recovery-enabled execution, promoting more robust and autonomous humanoid performance in real-world high-dynamic scenarios.",

When exploring such fabrics, fingertip skin senses both spatio-temporal force patterns and texture-induced vibrations that are integrated to form a haptic representation of the explored material. It is challenging to reproduce this rich, dynamic perceptual capability in robots because tactile sensors typically cannot achieve both high spatial resolution and high temporal sampling rate. In this work, we present a system that can sense both types of haptic information, and we investigate how each type influences robotic tactile perception of fabrics. Our robotic hand's middle finger and thumb each feature a soft tactile sensor: one is the open-source Minsight sensor that uses an internal camera to measure fingertip deformation and force at 50 Hz, and the other is our new sensor Minsound that captures vibrations through an internal MEMS microphone with a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 15 kHz. Inspired by the movements humans make to evaluate fabrics, our robot actively encloses and rubs folded fabric samples between its two sensitive fingers. Our results test the influence of each sensing modality on overall classification performance, showing high utility for the audio-based sensor. Our transformer-based method achieves a maximum fabric classification accuracy of 97 % on a dataset of 20 common fabrics. Incorporating an external microphone away from Minsound increases our method's robustness in loud ambient noise conditions.

Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.",

        "abstract": "Mining is rapidly evolving into an AI driven cyber physical ecosystem where safety and operational reliability depend on robust perception, trustworthy distributed intelligence, and continuous monitoring of miners and equipment. However, real world mining environments impose severe constraints, including poor illumination, GPS denied conditions, irregular underground topologies and intermittent connectivity. These factors degrade perception accuracy, disrupt situational awareness and weaken distributed learning systems. At the same time, emerging cyber physical threats such as backdoor triggers, sensor spoofing, label flipping attacks, and poisoned model updates further jeopardize operational safety as mines adopt autonomous vehicles, humanoid assistance, and federated learning for collaborative intelligence. Energy constrained sensors also experience uneven battery depletion, creating blind spots in safety coverage and disrupting hazard detection pipelines. This paper presents a vision for a Unified Smart Safety and Security Architecture that integrates multimodal perception, secure federated learning, reinforcement learning, DTN enabled communication, and energy aware sensing into a cohesive safety framework. We introduce five core modules: Miner Finder, Multimodal Situational Awareness, Backdoor Attack Monitor, TrustFed LFD, and IoT driven Equipment Health Monitoring. These modules collectively address miner localization, hazard understanding, federated robustness, and predictive maintenance. Together, they form an end to end framework capable of guiding miners through obstructed pathways, identifying compromised models or sensors, and ensuring mission critical equipment reliability. This work outlines a comprehensive research vision for building a resilient and trustworthy intelligent mining system capable of maintaining operational continuity under adversarial conditions.",

However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid locomotion has advanced rapidly with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling robust feet-based traversal over uneven terrain. Yet platforms beyond leg length remain largely out of reach because current RL training paradigms often converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose APEX, a system for perceptive, climbing-based high-platform traversal that composes terrain-conditioned behaviors: climb-up and climb-down at vertical edges, walking or crawling on the platform, and stand-up and lie-down for posture reconfiguration. Central to our approach is a generalized ratchet progress reward for learning contact-rich, goal-reaching maneuvers. It tracks the best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps, providing dense yet velocity-free supervision that enables efficient exploration under strong safety regularization. Based on this formulation, we train LiDAR-based full-body maneuver policies and reduce the sim-to-real perception gap through a dual strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering and inpainting to elevation maps during deployment. Finally, we distill all six skills into a single policy that autonomously selects behaviors and transitions based on local geometry and commands. Experiments on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (approximately 114% of leg length), with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, as well as smooth and stable multi-skill transitions.",

Existing methods struggle to generalize to multi-humanoid scenarios, which involve diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and frequent occlusions. We address this gap with two key innovations. First, we introduce unified motion representations that extract identity-agnostic motions and explicitly bind them to corresponding characters, enabling generalization across diverse humanoid forms and seamless extension to multi-humanoid scenarios. Second, we propose a holistic 4D-anchored paradigm that constructs a shared 4D space to fuse motion representations with video latents, and further reinforces this process with hierarchical 4D-level supervision to better handle interactions and occlusions. We instantiate these ideas in MotionWeaver, an end-to-end framework for multi-humanoid image animation. To support this setting, we curate a 46-hour dataset of multi-human videos with rich interactions, and construct a 300-video benchmark featuring paired humanoid characters.

A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control.

Yet, as humanoid robots begin to share our workplaces, homes, and public spaces, the design challenge expands. We must now consider not only factors for humans but also factors for humanoids, since both will coexist and interact within the same environments. Unlike conventional machines, humanoids introduce expectations of human-like behavior, communication, and social presence, which reshape usability, trust, and safety considerations. In this article, we introduce the concept of humanoid factors as a framework structured around four pillars - physical, cognitive, social, and ethical - that shape the development of humanoids to help them effectively coexist and collaborate with humans. This framework characterizes the overlap and divergence between human capabilities and those of general-purpose humanoids powered by AI foundation models. To demonstrate our framework's practical utility, we then apply the framework to evaluate a real-world humanoid control algorithm, illustrating how conventional task completion metrics in robotics overlook key human cognitive and interaction principles. We thus position humanoid factors as a foundational framework for designing, evaluating, and governing sustained human-humanoid coexistence.",

However, developing a unified controller that robustly supports diverse human motions remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically distill multiple expert policies into a single general policy, which often inevitably leads to performance degradation, particularly on highly dynamic motions. This paper presents TeleGate, a unified whole-body teleoperation framework for humanoid robots that achieves high-precision tracking across various motions while avoiding the performance loss inherent in knowledge distillation. Our key idea is to preserve the full capability of domain-specific expert policies by training a lightweight gating network, which dynamically activates experts in real-time based on proprioceptive states and reference trajectories. Furthermore, to compensate for the absence of future reference trajectories in real-time teleoperation, we introduce a VAE-based motion prior module that extracts implicit future motion intent from historical observations, enabling anticipatory control for motions requiring prediction such as jumping and standing up. We conducted empirical evaluations in simulation and also deployed our technique on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Using only 2.5 hours of motion capture data for training, our TeleGate achieves high-precision real-time teleoperation across diverse dynamic motions (e.g., running, fall recovery, and jumping), significantly outperforming the baseline methods in both tracking accuracy and success rate.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in humanoid whole-body motion tracking have enabled the execution of diverse and highly coordinated motions on real hardware. However, existing controllers are commonly driven either by predefined motion trajectories, which offer limited flexibility when user intent changes, or by continuous human teleoperation, which requires constant human involvement and limits autonomy. This work addresses the problem of how to drive a universal humanoid controller in a real-time and interactive manner. We present TextOp, a real-time text-driven humanoid motion generation and control framework that supports streaming language commands and on-the-fly instruction modification during execution. TextOp adopts a two-level architecture in which a high-level autoregressive motion diffusion model continuously generates short-horizon kinematic trajectories conditioned on the current text input, while a low-level motion tracking policy executes these trajectories on a physical humanoid robot. By bridging interactive motion generation with robust whole-body control, TextOp unlocks free-form intent expression and enables smooth transitions across multiple challenging behaviors such as dancing and jumping, within a single continuous motion execution. Extensive real-robot experiments and offline evaluations demonstrate instant responsiveness, smooth whole-body motion, and precise control.

        "abstract": "Effective human-robot interaction requires emotionally rich multimodal expressions, yet most humanoid robots lack coordinated speech, facial expressions, and gestures.

To bridging \\underline{\\textit{S}}peech, \\underline{\\textit{E}}motion, and \\underline{\\textit{M}}otion, we present \\textit{SeM$^2$}, a Vision Language Model-based framework that orchestrates emotionally coherent multimodal interactions through three key components: a multimodal perception module capturing user contextual cues, a Chain-of-Thought reasoning for response planning, and a novel Semantic-Sequence Aligning Mechanism (SSAM) that ensures precise temporal coordination between verbal content and physical expressions. We implement both cloud-based and \\underline{\\textit{e}}dge-deployed versions (\\textit{SeM$^2_e$}), with the latter knowledge distilled to operate efficiently on edge hardware while maintaining 95\\% of the relative performance. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms unimodal baselines in naturalness, emotional clarity, and modal coherence, advancing socially expressive humanoid robotics for diverse real-world environments.",

        "abstract": "Robotic policies deployed in real-world environments often encounter post-training faults, where retraining, exploration, or system identification are impractical. We introduce an inference-time, cerebellar-inspired residual control framework that augments a frozen reinforcement learning policy with online corrective actions, enabling fault recovery without modifying base policy parameters. The framework instantiates core cerebellar principles, including high-dimensional pattern separation via fixed feature expansion, parallel microzone-style residual pathways, and local error-driven plasticity with excitatory and inhibitory eligibility traces operating at distinct time scales. These mechanisms enable fast, localized correction under post-training disturbances while avoiding destabilizing global policy updates. A conservative, performance-driven meta-adaptation regulates residual authority and plasticity, preserving nominal behavior and suppressing unnecessary intervention. Experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks under actuator, dynamic, and environmental perturbations show improvements of up to $+66\\%$ on \\texttt{HalfCheetah-v5} and $+53\\%$ on \\texttt{Humanoid-v5} under moderate faults, with graceful degradation under severe shifts and complementary robustness from consolidating persistent residual corrections into policy parameters.",

The core component of DynaRetarget is a novel Sampling-Based Trajectory Optimization (SBTO) framework that refines imperfect kinematic trajectories into dynamically feasible motions. SBTO incrementally advances the optimization horizon, enabling optimization over the entire trajectory for long-horizon tasks. We validate DynaRetarget by successfully retargeting hundreds of humanoid-object demonstrations and achieving higher success rates than the state of the art. The framework also generalizes across varying object properties, such as mass, size, and geometry, using the same tracking objective. This ability to robustly retarget diverse demonstrations opens the door to generating large-scale synthetic datasets of humanoid loco-manipulation trajectories, addressing a major bottleneck in real-world data collection.",

        "abstract": "Achieving stable and energy-efficient locomotion is essential for humanoid robots to operate continuously in real-world applications. Existing MPC and RL approaches often rely on energy-related metrics embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework, which require extensive hyperparameter tuning and often result in suboptimal policies. To address these challenges, we propose ECO (Energy-Constrained Optimization), a constrained RL framework that separates energy-related metrics from rewards, reformulating them as explicit inequality constraints. This method provides a clear and interpretable physical representation of energy costs, enabling more efficient and intuitive hyperparameter tuning for improved energy efficiency. ECO introduces dedicated constraints for energy consumption and reference motion, enforced by the Lagrangian method, to achieve stable, symmetric, and energy-efficient walking for humanoid robots. We evaluated ECO against MPC, standard RL with reward shaping, and four state-of-the-art constrained RL methods. Experiments, including sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfers on the kid-sized humanoid robot BRUCE, demonstrate that ECO significantly reduces energy consumption compared to baselines while maintaining robust walking performance. These results highlight a substantial advancement in energy-efficient humanoid locomotion.

        "abstract": "Achieving robust vision-based humanoid locomotion remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the sim-to-real gap introduces significant perception noise that degrades performance on fine-grained tasks, and training a unified policy across diverse terrains is hindered by conflicting learning objectives. To address these challenges, we present an end-to-end framework for vision-driven humanoid locomotion. For robust sim-to-real transfer, we develop a high-fidelity depth sensor simulation that captures stereo matching artifacts and calibration uncertainties inherent in real-world sensing. We further propose a vision-aware behavior distillation approach that combines latent space alignment with noise-invariant auxiliary tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer from privileged height maps to noisy depth observations. For versatile terrain adaptation, we introduce terrain-specific reward shaping integrated with multi-critic and multi-discriminator learning, where dedicated networks capture the distinct dynamics and motion priors of each terrain type. We validate our approach on two humanoid platforms equipped with different stereo depth cameras. The resulting policy demonstrates robust performance across diverse environments, seamlessly handling extreme challenges such as high platforms and wide gaps, as well as fine-grained tasks including bidirectional long-term staircase traversal.",
